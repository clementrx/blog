Hi!

My name is Clément, and I am Data Scientist from France.

I'm a fan of R and use it daily.

I have a master's degree in economics from the [Toulouse School of Economis](https://www.tse-fr.eu/), and I have been working for [Epsilon France](https://epsilon-france.com/) since 2019 as consultant.

My personal projects are about horse racing in France.
